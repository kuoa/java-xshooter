# xShooter
My first attempt at a game project. Developing a top down shooter in **Java** using **AWT**.

### Story
The year is 2442. Earth is a distant memory. A lifeless, ravaged ball of dirt after the devastating strike of an alien super-race.

Your are a Space Defence Fleet special ops pilot. You are the only hope in restoring peace by destroying the alien war base.

Go to each colony, fight your way through all of the alien defences and end their reigns of terror.

Come home safe pilot!
